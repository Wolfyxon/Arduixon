# Arduixon
A small utility library I use in my Arduino projects.
Not much to see here.

Please note that this is specifically made for my hardware so you will likely need to update the pin numbers if you want to use this.

## Features
### Definitions
- `LED_BUILTIN` polyfill for *ESP32* (pin 2) and *ESP32S2* (pin 15)
- `ESP_SMALL` defined when compiling for my *ESP32S2*
- `ESP_BIG` defined when compiling for my *ESP32*

### Types
`ulong_t`: `unsigned long`
